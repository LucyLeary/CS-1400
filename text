This adventure game features Travis Kelce as he embarks on a journey to find Taylor Swift through a series of obstacles. In the first level, he must collect water droplets in the garden and water the seeds to grow a flower to give to Taylor. He must be careful not to touch the sides of the garden maze.
In the second level, Travis must avoid the paparazzi as well as other male celebrities in order to reach the end of the red carpet. The celebrities move across the screen and Travis cannot run into them.
In the final level, Kelce must give the rose to the correct woman. Kelce enters a maze that is made out of Taylorâ€™s album cover, and he is presented with a variety of women with their backs facing Kelce. He must give the rose to the correct woman, or he will have to restart the level.
Can Kelce impress Taylor with his rose? Put his skills to the test.
